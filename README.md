# Overview

Skookum JS, or *sjs* for short, is a JavaScript runtime focused on providing
comprehensive POSIX APIs.

The motivation for this project comes from answering the question "how would a
JavaScript runtime look like if there were no browsers?".

# Features

* Small footprint
* [Ecmascript ES5/ES5.1](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) compliant, some features borrowed
  from [Ecmascript ES6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html)
* [TypedArray](https://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/) and
  [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.12.1/api/buffer.html) support
* Built-in regular expression engine
* Built-in Unicode support
* Tail call support
* Combined reference counting and mark-and-sweep garbage collection with finalization
* CommonJS-based module loading system
* Support for native modules written in C
* Rich standard library
* Binary name 25% shorter than Node

# Acknowledgements

sjs would not have been possible without some other projects existing. Some served
as a source of inspiration, some as a source of actual code, and the author would like to thank them all.

* [Duktape](http://duktape.org/): The engine that powers sjs. This project would not have been possible without Duktape. :hearteyes:
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org): World's most well known JavaScript runtime, definitely an inspiration.
* [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv): A lot of the cross-platform code was borrowed from here.
* [Dukluv](https://github.com/creationix/dukluv): Another JavaScript runtime combining Duktape with libuv.
* [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython/): Python's canonical interpreter was an inspiration, specially for the standard library components.
